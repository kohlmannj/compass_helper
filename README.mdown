# Sass/SCSS Helper #
 
Version: 1.1
Author: [Joe Kohlmann](https://jgraphics.net)  
Build Date: 2009-10-20  
Compatibility: Tested on Symphony 2.2.5, should work for all 2.0.x versions

Lets you use Sass or SCSS ([Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets][1]) for your Symphony site.

## Installation ##
 
1. You'll need to have the Haml gem installed on your server to use this extension (Sass comes bundled with Haml). Please have a look at the Sass website for [installation instructions for Haml/Sass][1]. If you have `ruby` and `rubygems` installed already it should be as simple as:

        sudo gem install haml
 
2. Upload the `sass_scss_helper` folder in this archive to your Symphony `extensions` folder.
 
3. Enable it by selecting the "Sass/SCSS Helper", choosing "Enable" from the  with-selected menu, then clicking "Apply".
 
4. Links to `.sass` or `.scss` files in your templates will now be automatically converted to CSS.

## Usage ##

To use the Sass Helper you simply need to point your CSS includes to your `.sass` or `.scss` instead of `.css`. The extension will automatically find them and generate a `.css` file in the same directory. For example, this:

    <link href="{$workspace}/stylesheets/screen.sass" media="screen, projection" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />

Will be output as:

    <link href="http://domain.com/workspace/stylesheets/screen.css?mod-1248022788" media="screen, projection" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />

## Notes ##

As this extension uses the Sass gem to do the conversion you'll need to make sure PHP has access to the `sass` executable or its alias. If the extension isn't working for your out-of-the-box, try setting the `$sass_exec` variable at the top of `extension.driver.php` to the full path to the `sass` executable. It'll be something like `/usr/local/bin/sass`, you should be able to find out by typing `which sass` into the shell on your server.
